    The results from this study will help us learn about food and beverage consumption, specifically foods that people overconsume. These foods usually have higher
    amounts of fat and sugar and can lead to overeating and can be referred to as problematic or trigger foods. Food consumption can be influenced by hormonal,
    environmental, and neurological mechanisms. What we eat is often dictated by factors outside our conscious control and by these mechanisms.
